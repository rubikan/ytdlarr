**YTDLARR** is an *arr inspired app to monitor youtube channels and playlists for new videos and automatically download them.

## Planned features

- Track channels/playlists on Youtube (possibly additional filter options)
- Automatically download tracked videos, download them and move them to predefined folders
- Downloads can use configured yt-dlp parameters (e.g. only download mp3, different qualities etc.)
- Integrations with other *arr apps where useful
- Deployment via Docker
